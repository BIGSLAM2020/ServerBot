## My Server bot
I curiously wanted to explore insigts of how to build my own server bot.
I See it as best practice to build server bots to help user's be guided in server chat room.
Therefore, I see how I can test it out for now! It's beta to me!

# My Server room

https://discord.gg/XHYueh

Join my Server room to test out my command lines!!!!

## server chat lines 

!help or !multiply 
first two commands

Arugments are added: 
-- !multiply small sample math problems (basic)

!Help topic:
!help will just reply once and that's all for now 

$hello or $fine with $goodbye & $bad 

is similar functioning lines for the command server chat bot to reply back
